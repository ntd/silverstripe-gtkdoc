silverstripe-gtkdoc
===================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ntd/silverstripe-gtkdoc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ntd/silverstripe-gtkdoc)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/entidi/silverstripe-gtkdoc/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/entidi/silverstripe-gtkdoc)

The [silverstripe-gtkdoc](http://gtkdoc.entidi.com/) module implements
a new page type (*Gtkdoc*) that allows to import into the pages tree of
a [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org) based website a reference
manual generated by [gtk-doc](http://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/). The gtk-doc
page is a typical page and can contain arbitrary text: the reference
manual will be shown as a tree of (virtual) pages under it.

The only parameter required is the absolute path to a `.devhelp2` file
that identifies the gtk-doc reference manual to import. It must be
specified into the CMS, under the content tab. The module expects all
the html files to be in the same path, as usually done by a pristine
gtk-doc installation.

The HTML code is picked up directly from the file system. The usual
place where gtk-doc files reside is under `/usr/share/gtk-doc/html/`
(typical on GNU/Linux platforms) or `/usr/local/share/gtk-doc/html/`
(on BSD based systems). Those files are checked at every specific
request and are updated when required. The updated HTML code is
cached in the database under the `GtkdocSection` table.

For better results, a theme that supports menu with arbitrary nesting
levels, such as [silverstrap](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstrap/) or
[silverstripe-treeish](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstripe-treeish/),
is suggested.
